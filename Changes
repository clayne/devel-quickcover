            * Fix typo: medatada is really metadata...
            * Fix prerrequisites for the building and for testing.
            * Everywhere we now use JSON::XS instead of JSON.

            * Allow passing metadata only when calling import.
            * Change dump format to have an array of lines for each file.
            * Change av_top_index to av_len, trying to fix warnings

0.200001    2015-12-31
            * Improve how we manage dumping the cover data, whether when
              end() has specifically been called or when the module exits.
              Particularly relevant in the pressence of fork(), such as
              when running under Plack.
            * Check that all memory is properly disposed of; particularly
              relevant for long running processes (again, Plack).
            * Improve logging messages when compiled with -DGMEM_CHECK and/or
              -DGLOG_SHOW.
            * Don't break tests, use $^X instead of perl.
            * Be more succint with logging.
            * Attribute all authors in Makefile.PL.
            * Happy new year!
